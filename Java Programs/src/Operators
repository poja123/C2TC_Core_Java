Operators can be divided into three types
                                1.Unary Operators
                                            - One Operand (i) Logical NOT
                                                          (ii) Increament
                                                           (iii) Decreament

                                2.Binary Operators
                                                -Two Operands (i) Arithmetic Operators
                                                               (ii) Relational Operators
                                                                (iii) Logical AND
                                                                (iv) Logical OR
                                3.Ternary Operators
                                                -Three Operands (i)Conditional Operators
                                4.Instance Operators
